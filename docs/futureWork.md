# Future Work 

In order to be able to use the camera at greater depths, adjustments to the housing are required. The reason for this is the increasing pressure with increasing depth. The pipes used are already designed for a pressure of up to 16 bar, which corresponds to a depth of around 160 meters. To protect the viewing window from the pressure, its thickness can either be increased or the diameter of the window reduced. Reducing the diameter of the window would be a possible way to go with the positive side effect of reducing the size of the camera housing. To get there, the PoE adapter needs to be replaced by a space-saving network adapter to connect the Raspberry Pi to the network cable.    

To avoid negative influence of the infrared LEDs, it is advisable to mount them outside the camera. This improves the image quality and also enables better illumination of the scene to be observed in front of the camera.
