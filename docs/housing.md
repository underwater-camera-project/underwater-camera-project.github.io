# Housing 

The housing of the camera was made from water pipe components. These parts are available for various pressure levels and are made of PVC-U, a material that is easy to process. A watertight connection is achieved by bonding with a suitable adhesive. The viewing window is made of cast acrylic glass with a thickness of 8 mm. This window was glued into the housing with aquarium silicone. The slightly more expensive cast version was used as it does not exhibit any internal stresses, as is the case with rolled acrylic glass. BlueRobotics cable glands were used for the cable entry, as these are suitable for their cables and are easy to process.
