# About 

This project was created as part of my (Thomas Ederer) master's thesis and serves to make the knowledge gained and software components developed available to others as an open source project. For this reason, all artefacts are available under the MIT license. Details can be found in the respective repositories. The complete master's thesis will be published here after completion. 

Feel free to contact me by [email](mailto:2210781006@fh-burgenland.at) if you have any questions.
